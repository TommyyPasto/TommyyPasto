<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tommaso Pastorelli</h1>
<h3 align="center">an Italian undergraduate student for a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at "UniversitÃ  degli studi di Firenze" pursuing a career as a SWE specialized in ML</h3>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection from tabular data and Image data(also with Load Injection and Adversarial Attacks). As a consequence i'm also learning the basics of TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn and Numpy except for matplotlib which i already have a solid background with. The objective would be to learn how to implement these solution in real life with different cases and situation, so I will update my repo from now on with some projects relative to that.**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Java in general, Java for backend programming, MySQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML, C language, RISC-V, Python, Assembly 8086(i dont remember much since highschool i'll be honest). Also a little bit of Unreal Engine and Unity...**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me **tommasopastorelli39@gmail.com**

- âš¡ Fun fact **I find Karate and Gym, in general fighting sports really appealing to watch and practice. As boring and dull as it may seem, i often find myself enjoying the studying involved with a uni course(along obviously with the practice side of it). Also, i enjoy anime, games, I LOVE listening to music(almost all of it, especially rock, house, and rap) and i love learning new programming languages a lot... yeah that makes sense.**
